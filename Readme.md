# Interactive Time Series Forecasting App

This project is a Streamlit application for end-to-end time series forecasting and analysis. It allows users to:

- **Upload** a CSV dataset containing a time series.
- **Visualize** the original time series with rolling statistics (mean and standard deviation).
- **Decompose** the series into Observed, Trend, Seasonal, and Residual components (Additive/Multiplicative).
- **Forecast** future values using ARIMA, ETS (Exponential Smoothing), or Prophet models.
- **Evaluate & Compare** models using performance metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, MAPE).
- **Export** trained models in `.sav` format for later use.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

## Running the App Locally

From the `src` directory, run:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will launch a local server (usually at `http://localhost:8501`). Open the URL in your browser.

---

## Usage

### 1. Upload Dataset

- Click **Browse files** to upload a CSV with at least two columns: one datetime column and one numeric target column.

### 2. Visualization

- **Rolling Statistics:** Choose a rolling window size to display the time series with its rolling mean and standard deviation.

### 3. Seasonal Decomposition

- Select **Additive** or **Multiplicative** decomposition.
- Enter the seasonal period (e.g., 7 for weekly seasonality).
- View the four-panel decomposition plot.

### 4. Forecasting

- Choose a model from **ARIMA**, **ETS**, or **Prophet**.
- Enter the forecast horizon (number of future periods).
- Click **Train and Forecast** to see:
  - Interactive forecast plot.
  - Performance metrics table update.
  - Download link for the trained model (`.sav`).

### 5. Performance Comparison

- The bottom table lists all trained models with metrics:
  - MSE, RMSE, MAE, MAPE.
  - Best RMSE row is dark green (#337142).
  - Worst RMSE row is dark red (#811414).
  - Others are amber (#8b7400).
- Click **Export Model** to download the serialized model.

# Credit Card Fraud Detection - End-to-End MLOps Project

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques, versioned data pipelines, and MLOps best practices.

---

## Problem Statement

Fraudulent transactions represent a major financial risk for banks, customers, and businesses.  This project builds a robust end-to-end system to:
- Analyze transaction patterns
- Handle highly **imbalanced data**
- Build and optimize various **classification models**
- Track experiments, version datasets, and automate pipelines

## Key Features

- **EDA and Data Cleaning**:  Thorough exploration and cleaning of ~1.3M transaction records.
- **Data Versioning**: Using **DVC** to track versions of raw, cleaned, and model-ready datasets.
- **Handling Imbalanced Data**: Techniques like **RandomUnderSampler** and **SMOTETomek** to balance classes.
- **Feature Engineering**: Time-based aggregations, categorical encoding, and lagged feature generation.

- **Amount Analysis**: Fraudulent transactions often have smaller average amounts.
- **Category Analysis**: Certain merchant categories have higher fraud rates.
- **Time Series Decomposition**: Decomposed transaction volumes into seasonal, trend, and residual components.
- **Outlier Detection**: Applied IQR and Z-score methods for amount outlier analysis.
